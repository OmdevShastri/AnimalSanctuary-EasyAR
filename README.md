# AnimalSanctuary-EasyAR
Hello everyone, this is one of the projects made during my engineering course. I would like to thank my team members- Ankita Parkhe and Mamta Negi for their efforts in helping me finish this project as part of our course fulfilment. 
This project though not fully complete is an Augmented Reality project that aims to create an Animal Sanctuary which may be used for educational or fun exploration type game like experience.
